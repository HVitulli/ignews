This web app is a React News plataform created at Ignite course from Rocketseat.

There are three pages: Home, Posts and Posts/news. We can yet subscribe with the stripe service, so when you click at the subscribe button, you'll be redirected to the checkout stripe page. If you want to try a subscribe teste just use the card _4242 4242 4242 4242_ and a random adress.


  HOME:
 - Through this page, you can login with a github account, and Subscribe in order to get full access at the news page.
